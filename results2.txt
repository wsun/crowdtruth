Mitt Romney
If the president's re-elected, 'Obamacare' will be fully installed. In my view, that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per — per family. If I'm elected, we won't have 'Obamacare.' We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured. And we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be re-elected, you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare advantage. You'll have hospitals and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients. I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. If the president's re-elected, you'll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.

SO FAR Wells Fargo has been the one large American bank that has seemed to escape high profile legal attacks. That ended on October 8th with a civil complaint filed in a New York federal court that accused Wells of systematically defrauding the federal government’s mortgage insurance programme for a decade, stopping only after the receipt of a subpoena in 2011.

There is still the truth here: the cuts to Medicare in the President's plans don't hurt beneficiaries. The cuts will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund because they save the program money in the long term. Romney's plan would make Medicare insolvent by 2016, the end of his first presidential term, if he wins. And that does some serious damage to current retirees.

“If the president is reelected, you’ll see dramatic cuts to our military,” Romney said. “The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military.” Democrats and Republicans in Congress approved that plan before Obama signed it into law last year, but both parties have spent the last few months blaming the other for advancing the plan and for not finding an alternative.

Notice that Romney suggests that his plan will protect consumers by imposing government mandates, and then he proceeds to slam Obamacare for imposing government mandates.
